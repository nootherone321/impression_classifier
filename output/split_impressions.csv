borderline delayed filling of the gallbladder prior to administration of morphine  given the clinical context  this is most consistent with chronic cholecystitis
small lobe of right liver and splenomegaly with increased splenic flow  consistent with cirrhosis and congestive splenomegaly  this finding was
::
well maintained renal transplant perfusion with progressive tracer accumulation within the renal parenchyma and significantly reduced excretion in the early post-operative setting  these findings are most consistent with acute tubular necrosis
::
there are new lesions throughout the spine  right ribs  left ischium and acetabulum  and proximal right femur in addition  previously noted lesions are now more intense given that the patient was started on a new treatment regimen we with abiraterone and enzalutamide on 06/10/2015  cannot distinguish whether these changes represent disease progression or scintigraphic flare recommend repeat bone scintigraphy in 6-8 weeks to better assess response
::
low likelihood ratio for pulmonary embolism
symmetrically  mildly decreased perfusion of lower lobes relative to upper lobes (reversal of flow pattern)  this is most often associated with pulmonary venous hypertension  there is no evidence to suggest pulmonary venous hypertension in this patient (based on available information in the electronic medical record)  these flow changes may be related to the patient's systemic inflammatory state  the findings do not suggest pulmonary embolus  the results of this study were

no evidence of metastatic disease
functional thyroid tissue in the thyroid bed and thyroglossal duct
intermediate likelihood ratio for pulmonary embolism
relatively better perfusion compared to ventilation of the right lower lobe  suggesting a primary airway process rather than pulmonary embolism in this region  given the patient's known right hilar mass on imaging several months ago  a ct study may be warranted to further evaluate for airway obstruction
if contrast ct cannot be performed  a non-contrast ct would still be useful in this clinical setting  if the ct does not explain the patients symptoms  and there is still suspicion for pulmonary embolism  lower extremity doppler examination could be performed    the results of this study were

focal area of increased uptake in the left thyroid bed  presuming the patient has not had a prior partial thyroidectomy (which would make image interpretation more difficult)  this is most consistent with a large left parathyroid adenoma  with absence of thyroid uptake due to prior i-131 thyroid ablation
foci of mildly increased activity at t12-l1 vertebrae  nonspecific by scintigraphy alone but correlating with mri evidence of osseous metastatic disease
other findings as above likely representing degenerative disease   **

diffuse degenerative changes of bilateral shoulders
no additional abnormality suggest metastatic disease to bone  ::
no evidence of osseous metastatic disease
mildly increased uptake likely representing degenerative arthritis of the left shoulder  thoracic spine  right knee  and left midfoot  **
no scintigraphic evidence of osteomyelitis in either ankle or foot the focally increased uptake at the left tibiofibular syndesmosis represents heterotopic ossification likely secondary to prior trauma milder foci of increased uptake in the left foot described above may be due to a combination of trauma and arthropathy
increased flow and blood pool activity as well as soft tissue thickening and stranding overlying the anterolateral aspect of the left ankle is suspicious for a soft tissue infection
normal gastric emptying study
photon-deficient lesion along right lateral aspect of the t6 vertebra compatible with the known focus of metastatic disease
no other significant findings ::
normal contractile response of gallbladder to sincalide infusion
normal biliary imaging study ::

normal contractile response of gallbladder to sincalide infusion
normal biliary imaging study
normal cardiac blood pool study
the punctate sclerotic lesions noted at the t12 and l1 vertebral bodies have no corresponding increased activity on today's study  this is a nonspecific finding; possibility of a malignant process is not included  a short term followup ct or mri may be considered for further characterization
