by telephone 08/24/2017.  the patient is declining repeat breast mri at this
time. she will not be charged for the technically inadequate examination
already performed.

subject to its significant limitations, the current exam demonstrates a
residual 4-5 mm irregular enhancing mass in the axillary tail of left breast
corresponding to known biopsy-proven malignancy. there is surrounding
non-mass enhancement that is nonspecific (dcis versus reactive changes from
recent biopsy, versus combination of both). the measurement inclusive of all
abnormal enhancement is 1.0 cm transverse x 1.4 cm anteroposterior x 0.8 cm
craniocaudal.  a small focus of susceptibility artifact from the tissue
marker placed at prior biopsy is associated with these findings.  there is
no overlying skin retraction.

the largest left axillary lymph node measures 10 x 7 mm, with well preserved
fatty hilum and a cortical thickness of up to 3 mm; it may have a focal
cortical bulge. two additional left axillary lymph nodes have a cortical
thickness of up to 3 mm.  the left axillary lymph nodes are only slightly
asymmetric compared to those on the right, which have a cortical thickness
of 2 mm or less.

where visualized, the bone marrow and liver appear normal.

addendum issued dr. gilcrease-garcia by drs. gilcrease-garcia and siegel.

the ct head, face, and cervical spine were mistakenly associated with the
body ct report.  the neuroradiology findings, as reviewed with the
neuroradiology attending dr. manu goyal, are as follows:

head/face:  there is a subarachnoid hemorrhage along the left sylvian
fissure. no other intracranial hemorrhage or hematoma. normal symmetric
ventricles.  there is metallic shrapnel material along the right
frontoparietal skull, with slight thinning of the superficial scalp. there
is no skull fracture. circumferential thickening of the left sphenoid sinus
consistent with mucosal sinus disease.  there is a right maxillary sinus
polyp.

cervical spine:  there is fracture of the anteroinferior c4 vertebral body
with likely extension through the posterior cortex. there is mild associated
anterior height loss of c4 and focal kyphosis of the neck. there is no facet
subluxation or dislocation. in addition, there are nondisplaced fractures of
the lateral aspect of the right c5 and c6 transverse processes without
extension into the foramen transversarium.  there are no additional cervical
spine fractures. there is no osseous central canal stenosis. minimal

neuroradiology opinion:

1. small left sylvian subarachnoid hemorrhage.

2. c4 anteroinferior vertebral body compression fracture with mild height
loss. no posterior column involvement.

3. right c5, c6 nondisplaced lateral transverse process fractures without
extension into foramen transversarium.

4. metallic shrapnel embedded in right frontoparietal scalp and skull, with
no underlying fracture.  recommend correlation with physical examination.

the size of the enhancing mesenteric mass was misreported in the findings,
although is correct in the impression; the mass measures approximately 3.4 x
2.4 cm in maximal transaxial diameter.

prior comparison ct of the abdomen and pelvis from outside hospital from
07/23/2016 is submitted for comparison which was not available at the time
of initial reading of the study. compared to this prior imaging the
patient's known mesenteric mass is slightly decreased in size when
accounting for postsurgical changes and differences in mass orientation
status post bowel surgery. previously the mass measured 4.1 x 2.9 cm and on
the current exam measures 3.4 x 2.4 cm when measured in similar fashion.

the patient's right upper lobe pulmonary nodule is not visualized on the
prior comparison exam from 07/23/2016; however the indeterminate 4 mm
pulmonary nodule is stable. the previously seen left axillary fluid
collection, likely a chronic seroma from prior breast surgery is also
similar to prior imaging."
