ABR exam items
* removed non-pathologic terms
* separated multi-items terms (coronary artery stenosis and aneurysm --> coronary artery stenosis, coronary artery aneurysm)
* filled in hierarchical sub-categories with parent label (e.g. hypertrophic, dilated --> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy)
* separated item(item) groupins (e.g. admixture lesion (bidirectional shunts) --> admixture lesion & bidirectional shunts [synonym])
* specified on vague items, based on hierarchy ("trauma" multiple times in GI --> "pharyngeal trauma" "esophageal trauma")


To do
* lots of "bucket" categories need filled in:
** breast - benign & malignant male disease
